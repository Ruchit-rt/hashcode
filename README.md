Google Hashcode 2022

Here we worked on the problem set from google hashcode which involved manipulating a huge dataset of 
people with differents skills and expertise in order to get the most projects done.
The resulting code and provided data sets can be found in this repository.

This project taught me - **Team work, Efficiency and Big Picture thinking**

I learnt to manipulate datasets, read input efficiently and create data crunching algorithms all in **24 hrs!**.
